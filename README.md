## Description:
Welcome to Who’s That Pokémon v2.0! You're favorite place to test your knowledge on Pokémon names! The object of the game is to guess the Pokémon's name when presented when a picture, by using your keyboard to input letters.  Don't get too excited! We're not going to make it easier for you, with features like image blurring and hints during game play. Users will be excited to see chatting with other Users is still a feature, along with a cute trivia page as well!

## Motivation:
Motivation for this project was to refractor our original Who's that Pokémon? game using more efficient and powerful libraries and frameworks, as well as add some new functionality to our App.  

## User Story:
As a Pokémon trainer, I want to hone my ability to identify all the pokemon that exist. Who's That Pokémon? v2.0 allows me to practice until perfection, or until I can catch the real thing!

## Installation:

Clone the repository to your local development environment.
